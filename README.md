#  Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

This project demonstrates how to generate high-quality images from text prompts using pre-trained generative models like DALLÂ·E Mini and Stable Diffusion. By leveraging powerful text-to-image models, the system converts natural language descriptions into visually rich and coherent images. It showcases prompt design, model usage, and image output for creative or practical applications. This can be extended for tasks such as content generation, visual storytelling, and AI-assisted design.
